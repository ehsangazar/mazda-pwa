# Mazda Progressive Web Application
This is a sample Progressive Web App based on Mazda.com.au

I have been working on mazda.com.au for a while and I decided to implement the website in other way as a complete progressive web application.

I am also writing a blog which after publishing the post, I will update this readme


I am using Mazda.com.au as a sample of styles and content!


# Step 1: Initilizing the project!
I am using Next.js because it gives me:
- Server Side Rendering
- HMR (Hot Module Reloading) and Error Reporting

# Step 2: Adding Styled Component to the project
I am using Styled-Component in this project because:
- It has an awesome server-rendering
- It's readable 
- CSS like synstax

# Step 3: Enable Service workers
I want to cache everything for next.js in production to be able to see the website offline
