# Mazda Progressive Web Application
This is a sample Progressive Web App based on Mazda.com.au

I have been working on mazda.com.au for a while and I decided to implement the website in other way as a complete progressive web application.

I am also writing a blog which after publishing the post, I will update this readme


I am using Mazda.com.au as a sample of styles and content!
